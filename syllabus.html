          <h3>Prerequisite:</h3>
          <p>
            Algebra. If you already have taken single variable calculus, that
            will be helpful, but not required.
          </p>
          <h3>References:</h3>
          <p>
            All members of the class are suggested to read the following
            text:<br />
            &#9679; Susan Colley,
            <i>Vector Calculus (4th Edition)</i>.
            <br />
            &#9679; Michael Spivak,
            <i>Calculus</i>.

          <h3>Grading:</h3>
          <p>
            &#9679; 40% Homework<br />
            &#9679; 20% Midterm Progress Report<br />
            &#9679; 40% Final Project<br />
            &#9679; [Up to 5% Extra Credit]
          </p>

          <h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
          <p>
            &#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br />
            There will be weekly assignments. Communicating mathematics well is
            just as important as being able to do mathematics. Every assignment
            should be written up neatly with explanatory prose where necessary.
            <br /><br />
            Note: Each homework has both pdf and tex versions. To have the tex
            files successfully compiled, make sure that you have downloaded both
            <a
              href="https://github.com/aiml-29/resources/blob/master/homework/macros.tex"
              >macros.tex</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://github.com/aiml-29/resources/blob/master/homework/pset.cls"
              >pset.cls</a
            >
            and put them and the hw tex file under same folder.
            <br /><br />
            If you have any questions with regard to the compilation of the tex
            files, feel free to ask the TA for help.<br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br />
            The final project is the largest component of the course. Each
            student will discover, explore, and attack a real world problem of
            your choosing. The detailed description and requirements for the
            final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
            <br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br />
            As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to become
            comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required to create a
            Github account for coding assignment submission and final project
            submission. If you already have a Github account, that's perfect. If
            not, please create a personal Github account and go over the
            tutorials online.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
            account to TA for homework grading.
          </p>
          <h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
          <p>
            &#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br />
            Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
            class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
            for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
            responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
            <br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br />
            You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking (the
            PowerPoint slides will also be posted for your convenience).
          </p>
          <h3>Refund Policy:</h3>
          <p>
            Our refund policy is as follows: a student has until the second
            class meeting to request a drop and receive a full refund. Any drop
            past the second meeting will no longer be eligible for a tuition
            refund and will result in a No Credit grade being issued; however,
            if a student does receive a No Credit, we will allow him/her to
            enroll free-of-cost in any similar course offered by Dasion in later
            semesters.
          </p>
          <h3>Disabilities:</h3>
          <p>
            Students who need disability-related accommodations are encouraged
            to discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <h3>Note:</h3>
          <p>
            Upon completion of a course, Dasion will provide a certificate of
            completion. These courses are offered through Dasion, a company that
            is independent of Harvey Mudd College.
